🔹 1. Primitive Data Types
    * Definition: The most basic, immutable (cannot be altered) data types.
    * Stored by value (the actual data is stored in memory).
    * Operations create a new value instead of modifying the existing one.

Examples in JavaScript:
    * String → "Hello"
    * Number → 42, 3.14
    * BigInt → 123n
    * Boolean → true, false
    * undefined
    * null
    * Symbol

👉 Characteristics:
    * Simple and immutable
    * Comparisons check values directly
    * Copied by value    

    Example: let a = 10;
             let b = a;   // copy of value
             b = 20;
             console.log(a); // 10 (unchanged)



🔹 2. Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types
    * Definition: More complex data structures that can store collections or multiple values.
    * Stored by reference (variable holds a reference/address to the memory location).
    * Mutable (can be modified without changing the reference).

Examples in JavaScript:
    * Object (general type)
    * Array → [1, 2, 3]
    * Function → function() { ... }
    * Date, RegExp, custom objects, etc.

👉 Characteristics:
    * Complex and mutable
    * Comparisons check references, not values
    * Copied by reference             

    Example: let obj1 = { name: "Satyam" };
             let obj2 = obj1;   // copy reference
             obj2.name = "Pandey";
             console.log(obj1.name); // "Pandey" (changed, because same reference)


🔑 Main Differences:

| Aspect         | Primitive               | Non-Primitive (Reference)                      |
| -------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Stored as      | Value                   | Reference (memory address)                     |
| Mutability     | Immutable               | Mutable                                        |
| Examples       | Number, String, Boolean | Object, Array, Function                        |
| Comparison     | Compares value directly | Compares reference (address)                   |
| Memory         | Stored in stack         | Reference stored in stack, actual data in heap |



🔹 Return type of non-primitives in JavaScript
    -> In JavaScript, all non-primitive (reference) data types return "object" when checked with typeof.
    -> That’s because arrays, functions, dates, regex, etc. are all built on top of the Object type.
    
🔹 In JavaScript, arrays are a special kind of object
   Because arrays in JS are implemented as objects with numeric keys and some extra methods (push, pop, etc.).

If we want to specifically check if it’s an array:
console.log(Array.isArray(arrayName));  // true

Example:  const heroes = ["Ironman", "Thor", "Superman"];
          console.log(typeof heroes); // "object"
          console.log(Array.isArray(heroes)); // true

   Internally:
         const heroes = {
           0: "Ironman",
           1: "Thor",
           2: "Superman",
           length: 3
         };
 
   That’s how JavaScript treats it, plus additional array methods.

🔑 So:
    -> Array → a special type of object designed for ordered collections.
    -> All arrays are objects, but not all objects are arrays.
