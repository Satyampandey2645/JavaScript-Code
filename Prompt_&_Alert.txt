-------------------------- prompt() --------------------------

let a = prompt("Hey whats your age?");  // it will ask for your age and when you enter your age it will print it 
console.log(typeof a);  // the printed output of age will be of type string

The prompt() function is not available in Node.js, which is typically used in browsers. 
To accept input in Node.js, you can use the readline module. Here's an example of how to modify
your code for Node.js:

Code:
   const readline = require('readline');
   
   const rl = readline.createInterface({
       input: process.stdin,
       output: process.stdout
   });
   
   rl.question("Hey, what's your age? ", (age) => {
       console.log(`Your age is: ${age}`);
       rl.close();
   });
This will prompt for the user's age in the terminal and display the entered value.

Why prompt() works in Replit but not in Node.js:
* Replit provides a browser-like environment where prompt() is supported.
* Node.js, however, is server-side and doesn't have built-in support for prompt() because
  it doesn't have access to browser-specific functions. That's why using readline or other 
  methods is required in Node.js.


-------------------------- alert() --------------------------

alert() is a browser-specific function, and it is not available in Node.js, which is a 
server-side JavaScript runtime. Node.js does not have access to the browser's built-in functions
like alert() or prompt().

How to handle this in Node.js:
If you want to simulate something like an alert or display a message to the user, you can use 
console.log() in Node.js instead:

Code:
   console.log("This is msg");
This will print the message to the console when you run the script in Node.js.

Summary:
* alert() works in browsers, where you can interact with users using dialog boxes.
* In Node.js, use console.log() to output messages since Node.js doesn't have access to browser functions like alert().


---------- Difference Between prompt() and alert() in JavaScript: ----------

1. Purpose:
   --> prompt():
     * Used to display a dialog box that prompts the user for input.
     * The user can type a response, and that input is returned by the function.
   Example:
   Code:
   let userInput = prompt("Please enter your name:");
   console.log(userInput);
   Result: The user enters a value, which is stored in the userInput variable.
   
   --> alert():
     * Used to display a message in a dialog box.
     * It only shows a message and has an "OK" button to dismiss the alert.
   Example:
   Code:
   alert("This is a message!");
   Result: The user sees a message and clicks "OK" to close the alert box.

2. Interaction:
   * prompt(): Interactive; it expects the user to input something (e.g., text or a number).
   * alert(): Non-interactive; it simply displays a message and waits for the user to acknowledge
              it by clicking "OK".

3. Return Value:
   * prompt(): Returns the user's input as a string. If the user cancels the prompt, it returns null.
   * alert(): Does not return anything. It just shows the message.

4. Example:
   prompt() Example:
      * Code:
        let age = prompt("What's your age?");
        console.log(`Your age is: ${age}`);
      * The user is asked for their age, and whatever they input is stored in the age variable.

   alert() Example:

      * Code:
        alert("Welcome to my website!");
      * This simply shows the message "Welcome to my website!" with an "OK" button to close it.

5. User Control:
   * prompt(): Allows the user to cancel or close the prompt, which can result in a null value being returned.
   * alert(): The user can only click "OK" to dismiss the alert; thereâ€™s no option for input.

In summary:
   * Use prompt() to ask for input from the user.
   * Use alert() to display information or warnings to the user.
