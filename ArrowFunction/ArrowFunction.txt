⚡ Difference Between Arrow Function and Regular Function in JavaScript

| Feature                  | Regular Function                                                 | Arrow Function                                                                             |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `this` binding           | Has its own `this` (depends on how function is called).          | Does **not** have its own `this`; it inherits from the **lexical (outer) scope**.          |
| Syntax                   | Longer syntax with `function` keyword.                           | Short and concise syntax using `=>`.                                                       |
| Used as constructor      | Can be used as a constructor with `new`.                         | ❌ Cannot be used as a constructor (will throw error).                                     |
| `arguments` object       | Has its own `arguments` object.                                  | ❌ Doesn’t have `arguments`; must use rest parameters (`...args`).                         |
| `super` and `new.target` | Has its own binding.                                             | ❌ Does not have its own; inherits from parent scope.                                      |
| Best use case            | When you need your own `this` (like in methods or constructors). | When you want to preserve parent scope’s `this` (like inside callbacks or event handlers). |

✅ Short Interview Answer
Arrow functions don’t have their own this, arguments, or prototype. They inherit this from the surrounding scope, making 
them useful for callbacks. Regular functions have their own this and can be used as constructors.
