JavaScript is a single threaded language. In Js everything is a process.

In browser, 'window' is a global object and In Node.js, 'this' is global object

Browser Console Behavior Notes:

1. console.log() prints the value, BUT also returns undefined.
   That's why the console shows:
   output
   undefined

2. Example:
   console.log(document.links.length);
   -> Shows the length (output from log)
   -> Then shows undefined (return value of console.log)

3. If you want ONLY the value without "undefined":
   Just type the expression directly, e.g.:
   document.links.length

4. Browser console always displays the result of the last expression evaluated.
   console.log() returns undefined, so it appears.

5. undefined is NOT an error—it's just the console showing the return value.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. console.log(3 + "3");
This results in string concatenation because the + operator, when used with a number and a string,
converts the number to a string and concatenates the two:

Code:
   console.log(3 + "3"); // Output: "33"
   Explanation:
   * The 3 (number) is converted to "3" (string).
   * Then, the two strings "3" and "3" are concatenated, resulting in "33".

2. console.log(3 - "3");
This results in subtraction because the - operator tries to perform a mathematical operation, and 
JavaScript automatically converts the string "3" to a number for subtraction:

Code:
   console.log(3 - "3"); // Output: 0
   Explanation:

   * The string "3" is automatically converted to the number 3.
   * Then 3 - 3 equals 0.

Key Difference:
+ operator: If one of the operands is a string, JavaScript performs string concatenation.
- operator: JavaScript performs numeric subtraction, even if one of the operands is a string 
  (it will attempt to convert the string to a number).

3. console.log(3 * "3");
This uses the multiplication * operator. JavaScript tries to convert the string "3" into a number, 
then performs multiplication.

Code:
   console.log(3 * "3"); // Output: 9
   Explanation:

   * The string "3" is converted to the number 3.
   * Then 3 * 3 = 9.

4. console.log(3 / "3");
This uses the division / operator. Similar to the multiplication case, JavaScript converts the
string "3" to a number, then performs division.

Code:
   console.log(3 / "3"); // Output: 1
   Explanation:

   * The string "3" is converted to the number 3.
   * Then 3 / 3 = 1.

5. console.log(3 % "3");
This uses the modulus % operator, which returns the remainder of the division. JavaScript converts
the string "3" to a number before performing the operation.

Code:
   console.log(3 % "3"); // Output: 0
   Explanation:

   * The string "3" is converted to the number 3.
   * Then 3 % 3 = 0 because there's no remainder when 3 is divided by 3.

6. console.log(3 ** "3");
This uses the exponentiation ** operator, which raises the first number to the power of the second. 
JavaScript converts the string "3" into a number before performing the operation.

Code:
   console.log(3 ** "3"); // Output: 27
   Explanation:

   * The string "3" is converted to the number 3.
   * Then 3 ** 3 means 3 raised to the power of 3, which is 27.  

Summary:
JavaScript automatically converts the string "3" to the number 3 in these mathematical operations (*, /, %, **).
The results are as follows:
   3 * "3" → 9
   3 / "3" → 1
   3 % "3" → 0
   3 ** "3" → 27   


IMP: JavaScript is a dynamically typed language. This means that variable types are determined at runtime, and you 
     do not need to explicitly declare the type of a variable before using it. You can assign different types of 
     values to a variable during its lifetime.  

     On the other hand, statically typed languages require you to declare the variable's type explicitly, and the 
     type checking is done at compile-time, before the code is executed.

     Languages like Java, C++, and TypeScript are statically typed, and they require you to specify the variable 
     type explicitly when declaring them: 


------------------------------------------- Constructor ----------------------------------------------- 

In JavaScript, a constructor is a special method used to initialize objects when a new instance of a class 
(or function-based object) is created.

🧱 1. Constructor in a Class
      When you use ES6 classes, the constructor() method is automatically called when a new object is created 
      using new.
      Example: class Person {
                 constructor(name, age) {
                   this.name = name;  // 'this' refers to the new object
                   this.age = age;
                 }
               
                 greet() {
                   console.log(`Hi, I'm ${this.name} and I'm ${this.age} years old.`);
                 }
               }
               
               const satyam = new Person("Satyam", 21);
               satyam.greet();


⚙️ 2. Constructor Function (Before ES6 Classes)
       Before classes were introduced, developers used constructor functions to create objects.
       Example: function Person(name, age) {
                  this.name = name;
                  this.age = age;
                }
                
                const satyam = new Person("Satyam", 21);
                console.log(satyam.name); // Satyam

       Here, new Person() does:
       1. Creates an empty object {}.
       2. Sets this to that new object.
       3. Executes the function body.
       4. Returns the new object.

| Feature                        | Description                                                   |
| -------------------------------| ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Purpose                        | Initialize properties of a new object.                        |
| Called automatically           | When you use the `new` keyword.                               |
| Only one constructor per class | You can’t have multiple `constructor()` methods in one class. |
| Use of `super()`               | In subclasses, you must call `super()` before using `this`.   |

Falsy Values -> false, 0, -0, BigInt 0n, "", null, undefined, NaN
Truthy Values -> "0", "false", " ", [], {}, function(){}

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A callback function is a function passed as an argument to another function, which is then executed later after some 
operation is completed.

------------------------------------------------------ isNaN() ----------------------------------------------------------

isNaN() is a built-in JavaScript function used to check whether a value is Not a Number.

✅ What is isNaN()?
isNaN(value) returns:
   true → if the value is Not a Number
   false → if the value is a valid number

✔ Example:
   isNaN(10);       // false
   isNaN("20");     // false  → "20" can be converted to number
   isNaN("hello");  // true
   isNaN("");       // false  → empty string becomes 0
   isNaN(null);     // false  → null becomes 0
   isNaN(undefined); // true
   isNaN(NaN);       // true
