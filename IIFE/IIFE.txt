Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE):
It’s a function that runs as soon as it’s defined, mainly used to create a private scope and avoid polluting the 
global namespace.

Syntax:
Using regular function:
    (function () {
      // code here runs immediately
    })();

Using an arrow function:  
    (() => {
      // code here runs immediately
    })();

🔹 Why use IIFE?
1. Avoid polluting the global scope
   * Variables inside an IIFE are not accessible outside it.
2. Create a private scope
   * Useful before ES6 introduced let and const.
3. Run setup or initialization code immediately   

🔹 Key Points:
   * The parentheses around the function make it an expression (not a declaration).
   * The final () actually invokes it.
