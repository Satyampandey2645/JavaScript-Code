The Array object, as with arrays in other programming languages, enables storing a collection of multiple items 
under a single variable name, and has members for performing common array operations.

In JavaScript, arrays aren't primitives but are instead Array objects with the following core characteristics:
-> JavaScript arrays are resizable and can contain a mix of different data types. (When those characteristics are 
   undesirable, use typed arrays instead.)
-> JavaScript arrays are not associative arrays and so, array elements cannot be accessed using arbitrary strings 
   as indexes, but must be accessed using nonnegative integers (or their respective string form) as indexes.
-> JavaScript arrays are zero-indexed: the first element of an array is at index 0, the second is at index 1, and so 
   on — and the last element is at the value of the array's length property minus 1.
-> JavaScript array-copy operations create shallow copies. (All standard built-in copy operations with any JavaScript 
   objects create shallow copies, rather than deep copies).

--------------------------------------------  Array methods  ---------------------------------------------------------- 

Array.isArray(): The Array.isArray() static method determines whether the passed value is an Array.

from(): The Array.from() static method creates a new, shallow-copied Array instance from an iterable or 
        array-like object.

Array.of(): The Array.of() static method creates a new Array instance from a variable number of arguments, 
            regardless of number or type of the arguments.

includes(): The includes() method of Array instances determines whether an array includes a certain value among its 
           entries, returning true or false as appropriate. 

pop(): The pop() method of Array instances removes the last element from an array and returns that element. 
       This method changes the length of the array.

push(): The push() method of Array instances adds the specified elements to the end of an array and returns the new 
        length of the array.       

concat(): The concat() method of Array instances is used to merge two or more arrays. This method does not change the 
          existing arrays, but instead returns a new array.        

indexOf(): The indexOf() method of Array instances returns the first index at which a given element can be found in the 
           array, or -1 if it is not present.          

join(): The join() method of Array instances creates and returns a new string by concatenating all of the elements in 
        this array, separated by commas or a specified separator string. If the array has only one item, then that item 
        will be returned without using the separator.

slice(): The slice() method of Array instances returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array object 
         selected from start to end (end not included) where start and end represent the index of items in that array. 
         The original array will not be modified.

splice(): The splice() method of Array instances changes the contents of an array by removing or replacing existing 
          elements and/or adding new elements in place.

          To create a new array with a segment removed and/or replaced without mutating the original array, use 
          toSpliced(). To access part of an array without modifying it, see slice().   

          Syntax of splice():    splice(start, deleteCount, item1, item2)

toSpliced(): The toSpliced() method of Array instances is the copying version of the splice() method. It returns a 
             new array with some elements removed and/or replaced at a given index.          

shift(): The shift() method of Array instances removes the first element from an array and returns that removed element. 
         This method changes the length of the array.

unshift(): The unshift() method of Array instances adds the specified elements to the beginning of an array and returns 
           the new length of the array. 

toString(): The toString() method of Array instances returns a string representing the specified array and its elements.

sort(): The sort() method of Array instances sorts the elements of an array in place and returns the reference to the 
        same array, now sorted. The default sort order is ascending, built upon converting the elements into strings, 
        then comparing their sequences of UTF-16 code unit values.

        The time and space complexity of the sort cannot be guaranteed as it depends on the implementation.

        To sort the elements in an array without mutating the original array, use toSorted().

toSorted(): The toSorted() method of Array instances is the copying version of the sort() method. It returns a new 
            array with the elements sorted in ascending order.    

flat(): The flat() method of Array instances creates a new array with all sub-array elements concatenated into it 
        recursively up to the specified depth.
