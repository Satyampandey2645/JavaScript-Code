The reason the 5th button (“purple”) changes the background color even without CSS is:

✅ Because the JavaScript sets the background color using the ID name, and “purple” is a valid CSS color keyword.

When you click the purple button, this line executes:
    body.style.backgroundColor = e.target.id;

Here,
e.target.id === "purple"

So it becomes:
    body.style.backgroundColor = "purple";

Even if you did NOT assign any CSS to #purple in your stylesheet, the JavaScript still applies the background color to 
the BODY, not to the button.


👉 Why the purple button itself is not showing color?
Because you never added CSS for the element:
    #purple {
        background: purple;
    }
So the page background becomes purple, but the button stays white because its CSS is missing.

✅ Fix — Add CSS for the purple button:
    #purple {
        background: purple;
    }

Now everything works consistently:
    -> Button appears purple
    -> Background becomes purple on click
